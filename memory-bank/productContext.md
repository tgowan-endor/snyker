# Product Context: snyker

## Why This Project Exists

This project exists to simplify and automate interactions with the Snyk platform. While the Snyk API is powerful, it can be complex to use directly. The `snyker` library provides a Pythonic interface to the API, making it easier for developers and security engineers to build custom tools and automations on top of Snyk.

## Problems It Solves

-   **Complexity of the Snyk API:** The `snyker` library abstracts away the complexities of the Snyk API, such as authentication, pagination, and rate limiting.
-   **Automation of Security Workflows:** It enables the automation of common security workflows, such as CI/CD gating, vulnerability reporting, and policy management.
-   **Integration with Other Tools:** By providing a clean Python interface, `snyker` makes it easier to integrate Snyk with other tools and systems.

## How It Should Work

The `snyker` library should be easy to install and use. It should provide a clear and consistent API that maps directly to the concepts in the Snyk platform. The Pydantic models should be well-documented and provide a clear representation of the Snyk API data structures. The example scripts should be easy to understand and adapt for custom use cases.

## User Experience Goals

-   **Developer-Friendly:** The library should be easy for Python developers to pick up and use.
-   **Well-Documented:** The code should be well-documented with docstrings and type hints. The example scripts should be clear and easy to follow.
-   **Robust and Reliable:** The library should be well-tested and handle API errors gracefully.
