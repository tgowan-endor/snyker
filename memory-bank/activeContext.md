# Active Context: snyker

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the robustness and usability of the `snyker` library and its example scripts. This includes:
-   Fixing bugs in the core SDK models.
-   Improving the CI/CD workflow.
-   Adding new features, such as PURL-based issue querying.
-   Simplifying and speeding up the test suite.

## Recent Changes

-   Fixed a bug in the `Organization` model where issues were not being fetched correctly.
-   Fixed a bug in the `Group` model where the organization lookup was too strict.
-   Fixed several parsing issues in the `Issue` model to correctly handle all timestamp and severity fields from the Snyk API.
-   Unified the project's tooling around Poetry, including updating the `pyproject.toml` and the GitHub Actions workflow.
-   Simplified the unit tests to make them faster and more focused.
-   Added a new `PackageURL` model and a `fetch_issues_for_purl` method to the `Organization` model.
-   Created a new example script, `find_issues_by_purl.py`, to demonstrate the PURL functionality.
-   Created a new example script, `monitor_and_find_critical_issues.py`, to demonstrate a CI/CD gating workflow.

## Next Steps

-   Continue to improve the test suite by adding more mocked tests to reduce the reliance on live API calls.
-   Add more example scripts to demonstrate other common use cases.
-   Continue to improve the documentation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   The project will continue to use Poetry for dependency management and packaging.
-   The project will continue to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
-   The project will continue to use `pytest` for testing and `flake8` for linting.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   The project should follow PEP 8 guidelines.
-   All new features should be accompanied by unit tests.
-   The code should be well-documented with docstrings and type hints.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   The Snyk API has some inconsistencies in its data models, which requires careful handling in the Pydantic models.
-   The Snyk API has some asynchronous operations (e.g., `snyk monitor`) that require polling to get the results.
-   The `flake8` linter can be tricky to configure correctly to exclude the virtual environment directory.
