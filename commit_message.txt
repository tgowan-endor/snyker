feat: Add Memory Bank, parameterize examples, and prep for Pydantic v3

This commit introduces several new features and improvements to the snyker library and example scripts.

Features:
- Adds a new `PackageURL` model for representing Package URLs.
- Implements a `fetch_issues_for_purl` method on the `Organization` model to query for issues using a PURL.
- Adds a new example script, `find_issues_by_purl.py`, to demonstrate the PURL functionality.
- Adds a new example script, `monitor_and_find_critical_issues.py`, to demonstrate a CI/CD gating workflow. This script is parameterized for use in CI/CD environments and includes time-based policy checks.
- Adds the Memory Bank, a set of documents that serve as the long-term memory for the AI developer, Cline.

Fixes:
- Fixes a bug in the `Organization` model where issues were not being fetched correctly.
- Fixes a bug in the `Group` model where the organization lookup was too strict.
- Fixes several parsing issues in the `Issue` model to correctly handle all timestamp and severity fields from the Snyk API.
- Addresses Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings by replacing `class Config:` with `model_config = ConfigDict(...)` and `update_forward_refs()` with `model_rebuild()`, preparing the codebase for a future migration to Pydantic v3.

Tests:
- Adds a new test file, `test_purl_model.py`, with unit tests for the `PackageURL` model.
- Simplifies the existing unit tests to make them faster and more focused.

Tooling:
- Unifies the project's tooling around Poetry, including updating the `pyproject.toml` and the GitHub Actions workflow.
- Configures `flake8` to correctly lint the project's source code.
